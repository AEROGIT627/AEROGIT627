- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @AEROGIT627
      I am a retired mechanical designer of automated assembly machines in the medical, automotive, cosmetic and food industries. I was diagnosed with Parkinson's           Disease in January of 2020. 
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in creating a wireless (BLUETOOTH) remote controlled vehicle to transport my 1:32 scale slot-cars and slot-trucks to and from the various venues        along the circut.;-) The transport vehicles are 1:32/35 SEMI Tactor Trailer, diecast models. The European Race Truck Championship series transport vehicle will        include a full array of functioning lights and sound. The trailer will include working, bi-fold ramps and a means of, gently, ejecting the ETRC truck from the            piggyback transport position, onto the slot-car track. Hydraulic pump and metal ramp-type sound effects will accompany the ramp movement while deploying.
     The transport vehicle for the various GT Series race cars will include a folding lift-gate, upon which the cars will be unloaded from rack inside an enclosed          trailer and then lowered to the slot-car track. A means of, gently, ejecting the ETRC truck from the lift-gate will also be included.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning how to do simple programming, using an Arduino, BLUETOOTH and stepper motor driver modules, but my brain function is not so eager to absorb      the volumes of new information available on the YouTube. some of that might also be the limitations of a sixty year old brain that has been bounced off the            pavement servereal times. While wearing a helmet, of course.
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on those aspects that I have had no previous exposure to aspects such as; wiring, code and user-interface. Historically, I am strictly       a mechanical designer. I have always worked with dedicated electronic technicians and automation programmers to achive a working piece of automation assembly           machinery. As I intend to forgo the customary handheld radio transmitter and control everything via smartphone, I will need assistance either customizing an app       or generating one from scratch.
-  *  I have undertaken these tasks in an attempt to keep the draining symptoms of PD at bay. Like many Parkinson's patients, I find it impossible to remain awake           without something to occupy my brain. I must remain busy, even at the end of the day. It has to be more engauging than just sitting in my chair and watching           television.so, this is part of my therapy. I do not believe I am capable of learning complex ideas and methods but I am encouraged by what I have been able to         accomplish thus far. knowing that I will soon require help, I have sought out this forum in anticipation of coming up against that inevitable wall.
- üì´ How to reach me is through my email: aeronaut@aerobiker.us . I can also communicate via Skype and Whatsapp, if necessary as well as FB and by TWEETs...
